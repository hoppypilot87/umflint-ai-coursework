# Software Engineering for AI (SWE 520)

This folder contains coursework and deliverables from the SWE 520 course at the University of Michigan-Flint, part of the M.S. in Artificial Intelligence program. The course focused on best practices, pitfalls, and engineering rigor when developing machine learning systems.

## 📌 Course Overview

Topics covered include:
- End-to-end ML workflow and pipeline design
- Data leakage and debugging ML bugs
- ML deployment strategies
- Code smells and anti-patterns in AI codebases
- Refactoring and improving maintainability of ML projects

## 📁 Contents

- `Phase I.zip` – Initial submission containing early-phase designs, goals, and data preprocessing strategy
- `Phase II.zip` – Final submission demonstrating improvements, added functionality, and refinements based on code quality feedback
- `SWE 520 Syllabus Summer 2025.pdf` – Course syllabus outlining objectives, learning outcomes, and grading criteria

## 🔬 Project Summary

The course project was completed in two phases:

- **Phase I**: Defined the machine learning problem, established data flow, and documented potential anti-patterns and refactoring needs
- **Phase II**: Finalized the project with improvements in code quality, modularization, and documented implementation of AI system engineering best practices

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Gained practical experience identifying and correcting code smells in ML workflows
- Strengthened ability to apply engineering principles (like modularity and abstraction) to AI systems
- Developed awareness of common bugs and deployment issues in real-world ML applications
